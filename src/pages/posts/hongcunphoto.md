The ancient streets are lined with quaint homes, and the lanterns and red facades hanging at the entrance are particularly striking. When you walk into the village, a fresh scent comes to your nose and a light fragrance fills the air, making you feel extra comfortable.

"South Lake" and "North Gate", these two attractions are the landmarks of Hongcun. The South Lake has clear water and beautiful scenery, and there are old bridges and pavilions around the lake, which is a paradise for photographers. The North Gate is simple and elegant, with the words "The First Gate of the World" engraved on the gate, and an ancient temple inside the gate, giving people a strong religious atmosphere.

"Moon Marsh". This attraction is one of the highlights of Hongcun and is known as "one of the ten most beautiful water towns in China". The clear water of the Moon Marsh and the fish leaping around it, the shadows of the trees, and the moonlight sprinkling on the water at night, form a beautiful moonlight painting, which makes people forget to return.
